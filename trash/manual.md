# Introduction

## Research Topic

This research is geared towards finding correlation between user's biometric data to their performance in a first-person shooter gaming
scenario. The quality of the user data collected will be critical in ensuring that the research aims are achieved. For Quality Assurance
purposes, a systematic step by step approach has been designed for the data capturing process. 

An activity monitoring devices will be distributed to volunteers in the form of a Polar Watch. Individuals are expected to use these devices
at a pre-designated times prior to undertaking a test in the form of a First-Person Shooter Game. Results from the test will be paired with
their biometric data for further analysis. 

## Data of Interest

For the purpose of the research, different categories of data will be collected from the volunteers through the monitoring device to help achieve the stated goals. These data relates to the volunteers `physical information`, `sleep data`, `daily activities`, and `nightly recharge`. 

For the Test Game, volunteers are expected to play a total of 3 different categories of test to gauge their performance in these test. The tests are `Audio Test`, `Visual Test`, and `Fine Motor Test`. The tests are designed to be played sequentially and will typically take a total of 15 minutes to conclude. 

# Procedure

The data collection process is expected to follow the below listed steps to maximize throughput and minimize average time spent processing each participant.  

### Location

The data collection effort will be carried out at the Gym in Atlantic Technological University (ATU) Galway campus. 

### Time

The following weekly schedule will be available for volunteers at various times that best suite their personal schedule.
- Tuesdays: 12:00 - 13:00, 15:00 - 16:00
- Wednesdays: 12:00 - 13:00, 15:00 - 16:00
- Thursdays: 12:00 - 13:00, 15:00 - 16:00
- Fridays: 13:00 - 15:00

> *Note: The timing is open for adjustment to suite volunteers*

## Biometric Data Procedure:
**Physical Information**

These are the first group of data to be collected about the individual to register the Monitoring device manufacturer. The data is stored with the manufacturer (Polar) which is GDPR compliant.

**Sleep Data**

According to the manufacturers' manual, the watch is capable of recording the quality and quantity of sleep and also show how long spent on each stage of sleep. `Light Sleep`, `Deep Sleep`, `REM Sleep` with duration of each type of sleep. For the purpose of the research an aggregated total of the various categories of sleep will be recorded and used. 

> *Volunteers are expected to wear the watch to sleep the previous night before their scheduled test*
-           Sleep (minutes)

**Daily Activities**



The following metrics of interest will be collected at the end of the test: ``
