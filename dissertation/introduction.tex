\chapter{Introduction}

\textbf{PUBG:} Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown\'s Backgrounds) is a battle royale style player versus
    player shooter game developed by PUBG Studio. Players face-off with each other using various types of battlefield weapons
    in a last man standing deathmatch and the last person to remain alive wins. The game is available in all major platforms
    and as of March 2021, the mobile version of the game has accumulated more than a billion download outside of China with 
    revenue of over \$9billion while the PC and console versions have accumulated a total revenue of \$4billion
    \cite{statista}.
    \par 
    Since its first release in 2017, the game has since become one the fans favorite and has over `350,000' peak concurrent 
    monthly users~\footnote{statista}. As a multiple award-winning game with proven longevity records and a large community.
    Interest in the game cut across diferent demography and is equally far-reaching across the globe. 
    The game playing scenario requires players to face-off with other players and there is where some skills like 
    `eye-hand-coordination', `ear-hand-coordination', `fine-motor' skills, etc\.. are required to compete favorably against 
    other players. Players have access to a varieties of weapons with different capabilities and can make in-game adjustments
    to their control to suite their various preferences. 
    This project is a continuation of research work previously done by Fourth Year Software Design Students titled `Biometric 
    Data Collection for Performance Optimization in a Digital Game Scenario' in collaboration with the Department of Sports
     \& Excercise Science, Atlantic Technological University.
    \subsection*{Previous Projects}
    The originiating project titled \textbf{`Biometric Data Collection for Performance Optimization in a Digital
    Game Scenario'}, posed the question `can a player\'s biometrica data be used to optimise their performance in a 
    first-person shooter game'? And a subsequent follow up project which sought to create a Chart API capable of displaying 
    all relevant information previously displayed on different pages on a single page.\\
    The former research was geared towards creating a test environment where players can 
    practice and horn their skills in a similar scenarios (Weapons, controls, user perspective, ect\..) obtainable in PUBG\:: 
    Battlegrounds in the form of a Unity Desktop {\tt Application}. Collection and storage of Biometric data from an 
    {\tt Activity Monitor} in the form of a {\tt Smart Watch}. With the enventual goal of finding correlation between their
    performance and their Biometric data.
