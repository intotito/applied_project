\textbf{Background and Objective} The aim of this project is to analyze the relationship between the fitness status of a gamer and their 
performance in a digital gaming scenario. And if such relationship could be established, to determine which features affects their performance and 
to what degree do they contribute to their performance. 
Various biometric and fitness data were considered and used fo the analysis based on their suitability for capturing relevant fitness features that 
correlate to on's physiological state. Heart rate variability (HRV), Average Heart Rat, maximum Heart Rate, Active Steps and quality of sleep are the 
features under consideration. 

A test game designed to measure and capture user's performance in a first-person shooter gaming scenario was used. Three basic metrics where chosen 
to measure user performance. They are Fine Motor Test, Visual Test and Audio Test. The Fine motor test captures the average tracking time and accuracy 
for engaging targets, the Visual Test captures the average response time, average tracking time and accuracy while the Audio Test captures user's 
response time.
