    \section*{Project Name}
    Biometric Data Analysis in Digigal Game Sceneiro
    \section{Project Context}
    This project is a continuation of research work previously done by Fourth Year Software Design Students titled 'Biometric Data Collection for
    Performance Optimization in a Digital Game Scenario' in collaboration with the Department of Sports \& Excercise Science.
    The aim of the project is to use data collected from the already developed {\tt Test Application } and Biometric data from {\tt Activity Monitor}
    to answer the following questions: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{d}
    \end{itemize}

    Battlegrounds is a {\tt battle royale game} played from either a {\tt first-person} or {\tt third-person} perspective. 
    It requires players to engage other players in a shoot-em-up duel

    Does the Application test data show any corelation with the physical activity data collected by {\tt activity monitor}
